# Creating mod repository

To release a modification for public use, you need to configure the mod so that BYDLE systems will recognize it. To do this, create a repository on [GitHub](https://github.com). You can set the license according to your needs.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to set the visibility to **Public**, as BYDLE **requires all mods to be open-source** and the code to be accessible. Ensuring transparency not only meets BYDLE's standards but also fosters community collaboration and trust.
{% endhint %}
